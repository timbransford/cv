      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="profile-p">
        I am a web, desktop and mobile developer. I have been programming since
        1980. I began with C, Pascal and PL1. My first programs were punched on cards
        to be batch processed on a DEC PDP-11. I have produced web applications with
        Ruby on Rails and written software for every desktop and mobile platform
        available today. My extensive experience with C++, Java, Swift, Ruby, C#
        and even VBA have allowed me to produce software that has been in use for
        over 15 years. I also enjoy coffee, flying airplanes, and spending large
        amounts of my free time with my family.

        <h3>Desktop</h3>
        <p>
          I've written several desktop applications many of which have been in
          continuous use for over a decade. I primarly produce desktop software
          using Java now but I have produced software for Excel and Desktop using
          C# and VBA.

        <h3>Mobile</h3>
        <p>
          Although I am relatively new to mobile design, I am versed in Java and
          Swift. I've started Bransfordware primarly to produce the same high
          quality software for Android and iOS that I've been able to produce
          for the desktop.
